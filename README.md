## üßê Introduction

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust predictive model to forecast hotel booking cancellations. By accurately identifying bookings that are likely to be canceled, hotels can better optimize room allocation, manage revenue streams, and implement effective customer retention strategies. This project leverages machine learning to provide actionable insights from historical booking data.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains **119,390 booking records** with **32 distinct features**. This is a **binary classification problem** where the goal is to predict the `is_canceled` feature (1 for canceled, 0 for not canceled).

* **Key Features:** `lead_time`, `adr`, `hotel`, `country`, `previous_cancellations`.
* **Data Imbalance:** The dataset is imbalanced, with **37.04%** of bookings being canceled and **62.96%** not canceled. This was addressed using stratified splitting to maintain class distribution during training and testing.

## ü§ñ Methodology

The project followed a structured machine learning workflow:

1.  **Data Pre-processing:**
    * Handled missing values by dropping the `company` column and imputing values for `agent`, `country`, and `children`.
    * Prevented data leakage by removing the `reservation_status` and `reservation_status_date` columns.
    * Removed invalid records where the total number of guests was zero.
    * Normalized numerical features using `StandardScaler`.

2.  **Dataset Splitting:**
    * The data was split into an **80% training set** and a **20% test set** using a stratified approach.

3.  **Model Training & Testing:**
    * **Supervised Models:**
        * Logistic Regression
        * Decision Tree Classifier
        * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
        * Neural Network (MLPClassifier)
    * **Unsupervised Model:**
        * K-Means Clustering

## üìà Results

The performance of the supervised models was compared based on Accuracy, Precision, and Recall. The **Neural Network (MLP)** was selected as the best model due to its superior performance across all metrics.

| Model                  | Accuracy          | Precision         | Recall            |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Logistic Regression    | 80.33%            | 77.88%            | 65.54%            |
| Decision Tree          | 85.49%            | 84.07%            | 77.66%            |
| K-Nearest Neighbors    | 83.59%            | 79.63%            | 76.75%            |
| **Neural Network (MLP)** | **87.15%** | **84.27%** | **82.42%** |

The Neural Network also achieved the highest AUC score, confirming its effectiveness in distinguishing between canceled and non-canceled bookings.
